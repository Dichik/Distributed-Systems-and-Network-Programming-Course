Use the following code to write a client-server application so that when each client logs in, 
the server chooses one of three possible questions 
(Choose how to store the questions, as a list, as a dictionary, or otherwise) 
and sends the question to the customer. 
The client returns an answer to the question and waits for the server to confirm the reception of the data. 
If the client does not receive a confirmation, it gives information that the server is no longer working.
